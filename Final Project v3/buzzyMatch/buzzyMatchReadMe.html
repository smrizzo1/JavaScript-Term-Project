    Buzzy Match is a fun, interactive game for younger players.
    <br>
    <br>
    How to play the Buzzy Match game:
    <br>
    <br>
    There are 9 pairs of matching flower tiles. Click on two tiles to flip them over. Try to remember the location and
    type
    of
    flower on each tile. Click on two more tiles to continue. When you find a matching pair, the flowers will remain
    unflipped. Once you have found all of the pairs, you win!

    <br>
    <br>
    If you flip the tiles too quickly, they will "stick" open, so don't too fast! This may also affect your score.
    Please have patience with us while we improve our game.

    <br>
    <br>
    Future releases with more tiles and celebration animation planned - stay tuned!
