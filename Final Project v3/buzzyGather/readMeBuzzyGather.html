    How to play the Buzzy Gather game:
    <br>
    <br>
    Help Buzzy gather the flowers without getting caught by a net or poked by a stick! Use your mouse or touchscreen to
    move Buzzy up, down, left (backward) or right (foward) with
    the buttons to avoid the obstacles and collect the flowers. Collect 20 flowers to win!
